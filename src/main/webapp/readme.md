# WEB-RTC running examples

These examples are to be used with a running Red5Pro server. 
Currently, they are set up to be used in the localhost, without TSL. 
In the future we will set them up for the TSL and they will be located in a different repository.
OR a different branch. 
Once we get ready to deploy on the production servers, we will start setting up TSL.
